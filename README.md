## Northwind VB 3\-tier demo


</div>

### Description

This code is a demonstration of a 3-tier application and contains excellent structure and coding practices. It is based on the Microsoft Northwind database. This is a must for any supposed 3-tier serious developers of wanna be developers. Uses COM+ and ADO 2.5 but can be easily changed to run in MTS.
 
### More Info
 
To use this code you need to run the sp creation scripts included in the zip, create a DSN to a SQL Server Northwind database and have ADO 2.5 on a Windoze 2000 development machine. This version is intended to run against a SQL Server (6.5/7.0/8.0 beta) backend database but may look at posting a MSAccess version if enough people request it.
